# Markdown Translator
## What is it?
Markdown Translator is a simple tool that converts markdown code to html, and vice versa.
## When is it useful?
It is useful when you have documentation on a github repository, but you also want to use that documentation in a website form. Using this tool you can very easily convert from the markdown to HTML, or vice versa, rather than having to go through and do it yourself.
## How to use it?
### Converting Markdown to HTML
To convert markdown to HTML code, simply type your markdown into the textarea on the left, and a preview will be shown on the right side of the screen. To access the html code, click the "code" button, found above the preview pane.
### Converting HTML to Markdown
To convert HTML code to markdown, click the *code* button, which is found above the preview pan. You can then type your html code into the textarea on the right, and it will be converted into markdown on the left side of the screen.
